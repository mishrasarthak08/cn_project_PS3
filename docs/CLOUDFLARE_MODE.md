# Tunnel mode (`NETWORK_MODE=tunnel`)

Purpose: Shitanshu and Shane are remote. Sarthak and Preetish stay on one LAN. **Only nginx -> backend travels over Cloudflare.**
Cloudflare does *not* handle client-facing DNS or TLS: the client still resolves via dnsmasq and validates a certificate issued by our own CA at nginx.

Not equivalent to the original brief (no shared LAN, uses a cloud service). Ask faculty before submitting in this mode; keep `lan` working.

## Address plan
| Component | Owner | Virtual IP | Port | Tunnel |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Edge Proxy | Preetish | 10.250.0.2 | 8443 | `cn-edge` |
| Backend A | Shitanshu | 10.250.0.3 | 3001 | `cn-backend-a` |
| Backend B | Shane | 10.250.0.4 | 3002 | `cn-backend-b` |

nginx upstreams are ordinary `IP:port`. On each Mac running a service (Edge or Backend), the setup adds `sudo ifconfig lo0 alias <virtual-ip> 255.255.255.255` because `cloudflared` delivers private-network traffic to the destination IP as-is, so the Mac must own it. (The alias disappears on reboot; `./bin/start` re-adds it.) No router port-forwarding is needed - `cloudflared` only makes outbound connections.

## One-time admin steps (Sarthak)
Automated by `admin/bootstrap-cloudflare.sh` (use `--dry-run` first):
1. `cloudflared tunnel login`
2. Creates tunnels: `cn-edge` (routes `10.250.0.2/32`), `cn-backend-a` (`10.250.0.3/32`), `cn-backend-b` (`10.250.0.4/32`).
3. Saves one credentials file per tunnel in `~/.config/cn-phase1/admin-out/` (chmod 600).

**Manual (cannot be scripted safely):**
1. Create a free Cloudflare Zero Trust organisation (dash.cloudflare.com -> Zero Trust).
2. Zero Trust -> Settings -> WARP Client -> Device settings -> **Split Tunnels**: ensure `10.250.0.0/24` is *not excluded*. In default *Exclude* mode `10.0.0.0/8` is excluded, so traffic would never enter the tunnel.
3. Zero Trust -> Settings -> WARP Client -> Device enrollment permissions: allow team members' identities.
4. Send each owner **only their own** credentials file (AirDrop / password manager). Never git, never a shared channel that keeps history.

## Per-Mac Setup (Fully Remote)
* **Shitanshu (Backend A):** `NETWORK_MODE=tunnel ./macs/mac3-shitanshu/setup.sh --credentials <credentials-cn-backend-a.json>`
* **Shane (Backend B):** `NETWORK_MODE=tunnel ./macs/mac4-shane/setup.sh --credentials <credentials-cn-backend-b.json>`
* **Preetish (Edge):** `NETWORK_MODE=tunnel ./macs/mac2-preetish/setup.sh --credentials <credentials-cn-edge.json>`
* **Sarthak (Client + DNS):** Install/connect to Cloudflare WARP, then `NETWORK_MODE=tunnel ./macs/mac1-sarthak/setup.sh`. Sarthak's dnsmasq resolves `app.team1.test -> 10.250.0.2`. All HTTPS traffic to `:8443` flows through WARP to Preetish's Edge!

Credentials are stored at `~/.config/cn-phase1/secrets/` (`tunnel-credentials.json` or `tunnel-token`, chmod 600). A dashboard-created remotely managed tunnel (token) also works - add the private network route to it in the dashboard.

## Verifying
`./bin/status` (Backend A/B via edge, tunnel A/B inferred), `./bin/doctor` (CLOUDFLARE layer), and on a backend Mac `./macs/mac3-shitanshu/status.sh` (shows `Cloudflare tunnel CONNECTED`). Logs: `~/Library/Logs/cn-phase1/cloudflared.log`.
